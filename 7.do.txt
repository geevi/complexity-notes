========= Lecture 7: NL = coNL, Randomization ========= 

======= Recapping Nondeterminism =======

When do we say a Nondeterministic TM accepts a languages?

Why is it not obiviously true that $NP = coNP$.?

Verifier definition of NP, NL.

======= Immerman-Szelepcsenyi Theorem : NL = coNL =======

In time complexity, we didnt have a proof of NP = coNP. This remains an open problem.
However in space complexity, we know that NL = coNL. This theorem is known as the 
Immerman-Szelepcsenyi Theorem.
See Section 8.6 in Sipser book.


!bu-problem
Given an NL algorithm (use verifier definition) :
    o which on input a graph $G(V,E)$, vertices $s,t \in V$ and a number $i$, checks if $s$ is reachable from $t$ in $\leq i$ steps.
    o which on input a graph $G(V,E)$, verticex $s \in V$ and a numbers $i, c$, checks if the number of vertices reachable from $s$ in $i$ steps is  $\geq c$.
    o which on input a graph $G(V,E)$, verticex $s \in V$ and a numbers $i, c$, checks if the number of vertices not reachable from $s$ in $i$ steps is  $=c$.

!bu-problem
Show that
    o RP $\subseteq$ BPP
    o coRP $\subseteq$ BPP
    o BPP $\subseteq$ PSPACE
    o RP $\subseteq$ NP
    o BPP $=$ coBPP

*Bonus Problem*
A forest is a graph which is a disjoint union of trees (ie tree on different set of vertices).
Show that REACHABILITY in a forest can be solved using $O(\log n)$ space.
