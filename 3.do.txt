========= Lecture 3: Non Determinism, NP and Search Problems ========= 

======= Non Deterministic Turing Machines ======= 

Last lecture we saw that TM's can be encoded as strings and simulated by a
universal TM using the configurations. We also saw that simulation of a TM,
is essentialy tracing a path in the configuration space. But in the TMs that 
we defined, the out degree of any node (a configuration) 
in the graph (in the configuration space) is one. 

Similar to the Nondeterministic finite automata, we can also define TMs 
with delta rules that results in multiple next states 
(called Nondeterministic Turing Machines or NTMs). Then the delta rules
will be of the form $\delta:\Omega\times \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Omega\times \mathcal{T}\times \{\langle, \rangle, -\})$.
($\mathcal{P}$ denotes the power set). So the configuration graph of a 
NTM can have out degree greater than $1$. However the it still has to be a finite 
number since the size of $\mathcal{P}(\Omega\times \mathcal{T}\times \{\langle, \rangle, -\})$ is 
finite. Following the different paths, an NTM could accept, reject or keep looping.
So we need to define what is meant by deciding a language by an NTM.

An NTM is said to decide a language (a descision problem) $L$ iff,
for all strings in the language, there exists one path in the configuration 
space that results in accept state.  For strings not in the language, all 
paths in the configuration space should result in reject state.

We know that NFA (Nondeterministic Finite automata) can always be converted to 
a deterministic one. However for Pushdown Automaton this coverstion is not possible
always. We will see that for TMs, this conversion can always be done. That is the 
set of languages that can be decided by TMs does not change by allowing 
nondeterminism.

Recall that UTM simulated a deterministic TM, by tracing the path in the configuration
space. But for NTMs, the graph in the configuration space is a tree. A simple 
idea is for a UTM to do a graph traversal. DFS might be a bad idea, because
some of the paths go into infinite loops. Hence it can to BFS. The first time,
it finds that the NTM has reached the accept state, the UTM can also accept.
If it never finds an accept state, the simulating TM rejects.

======= Nondeterministic Polynomial Time : NP ======= 

As we disscussed earlier, an NTM can take different paths in the configuration space.
The length of the path is essentialy the number of steps. Now we will define 
the worst case running time for a NTM. 

For a language $L$, on inputs of size $n$, the worst case running time of an NTM 
is the length of the longest path in the configuration space on any of the inputs 
of size $n$.

NP or Nondeterministic Polynomial time  is the class of descision problems for which,
there is an NTM which decides it in worst case polynomial time.

======= NP : Verifier Definition ======= 

We will define descision problems that are *verifiable*. A descision problem 
is said to be verifable if there exists  a deterministic TM $M$ that takes two 
inputs $(x,y)$ where $x$ is an instance of the descision problem and $y$ is
called a certificate which has length of  atmost $p(n)$ where $p$ is a polynomial. 
For YES-instances $x$, there should exist a certificate 
$y$ such the $M$ accepts the input $(x,y)$. For instances not in the language,
for every $y$ of length $p(n)$, $M$ should reject on $(x,y)$. Also the running
time of $M$ must be polynomial time in size of $x$.

An example of a verifiable language is the Clique problem.

!bt
\text{CLIQUE} = \{ (G,k): G \text{ has a clique of size } k  \}
!et

A certificate for YES-instance $(G,k)$,  is just the list of vertices in a $k$-clique.
The polynomial time verifier just checks if there is an edge between all pairs of
vertices. If $(G,k)$ is not in the language, then for any set of $k$ vertices,
that you can give to the verifier, it will reject, since there will not be an 
edge between some pair in the list.
