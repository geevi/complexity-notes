========= Lecture 8: Randomized Algos ========= 

=======  BPP and Amplification  =======

Last lecture we saw that $\text{RP}_{1/100} = \text{RP}_{99/100}$. 
This lecture we said that $\text{BPP}_{1/2 + \epsilon} = \text{BPP}_{1 - \epsilon}$
for any small constant $\epsilon$.

!bu-problem
Let $\text{BPP}_\alpha$ be the class of languguages L that have a PTM M such that
    o If $x\in L$ then $\Pr[M(x) \text{accepts}] \geq \alpha$.
    o If $x\notin L$ then $\Pr[M(x) \text{rejects}] \geq \alpha$.
 
Show that:
    o $\text{BPP}_{1/2}$ is the set of all languages.
    o $\text{BPP}_{2/3} = \text{BPP}_{20/27}$ (without using Chernoff's Bounds).

=======  Approx MAX-CUT  =======

!bu-problem
The Approximate-$7/8$-$3$SAT problem is given an input a $3$-SAT boolean formula,
find an assignment that satisfies atleast $7/8$ fraction of the clauses (ie if 
there are $m$ clauses, find an assignment that satisfies $m\times 7/8$ clauses).

Give a randomized algorithm which solves Approximate-7/8-3SAT (answer just need
to be correct in expectation as we discussed for the MAXCUT problem in class.).

======= Undirected REACHABILITY in RL ======= 

See Section 2.4 in 
https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/pseudorandomness/power.pdf

!bu-problem
Let M be the adjacency matrix of a undirected $d$-regular graph $G$ (all vertices have exactly $d$ neighbours).
Show that:
    o $d$ is an eigenvalue of $M$.
    o If $c$ is the number of connected components in $G$, then there are $c$ linearly independent eigenvectors of $M$ with eigen value $d$.
    o If $G$ is a bipartite graph then $-d$ is an eigenvalue of $M$.

_Bonus Problem_
Let M be the adjacency matrix of a undirected $d$-regular graph $G$ (all vertices have exactly $d$ neighbours).
Show that:
    o If there are $c$ linearly independent eigenvectors of $M$ with eigen value $d$ then $G$ has $c$ connected components.
    o If $-d$ is an eigenvalue of $M$ then $G$ is a bipartite graph,.
